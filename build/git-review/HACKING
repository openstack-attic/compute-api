Development of git-review is managed by OpenStack's Gerrit, which can be
found at https://review.openstack.org

Instructions on submitting patches can be found at

git-review should, in general, not depend on a huge number of external
libraries, so that installing it is a lightweight operation.

All code should be pep8-compliant. It won't merge otherwise.

A tox config file has been added for easy local testing. Just run:

  tox

And it will check the code for you.
